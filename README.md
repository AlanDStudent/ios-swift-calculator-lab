### Practicing Math with Swift
- We're going to put what we've learned about variables and data types into practice. We're going to build a calculator that works almost exactly like the one on your phone.

- First, fork this repository. Then, clone the repository.

- Follow the directions in the comments to complete the calculator's functions.

- If you are trying to concatenate a string with your variables and getting an error, check out this stackoverflow post:

- Swift can do much more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide. 

- Take a look at this blog: https://www.dotnetperls.com/math-swift. There are lots of examples of mathmatical functions that Swift can now carry out, like sqrt(), log(), and sin().
